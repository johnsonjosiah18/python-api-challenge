Part 1: WeatherPy

In this deliverable, a Python script is created to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. Sources used are the citipy Python libraryLinks to an external site., the OpenWeatherMap APILinks to an external site., and your problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.

The WeatherPy.ipynb Jupyter notebook provided in the starter code ZIP file. The starter code will guide you through the process of using your Python coding skills to develop a solution to address the required functionalities.

To get started, the code required to generate random geographic coordinates and the nearest city to each latitude and longitude combination is provided.

Requirement 1: Create Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude
To fulfill the first requirement, you'll use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities list generated in the starter code. Next, you'll create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

Requirement 2: Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship

Part 2: VacationPy

The main tasks are to use the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library and employ your Python skills to create map visualizations.
